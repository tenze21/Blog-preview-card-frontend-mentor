## Overview
I have designed the blog preview card from the front end mentor challenge. I have also used hover effect on the profile picture so that viewers can view it clearly if they want to. You think it's useful?

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
for this project i have used a bit of CSS grid to make myself familiar with it since it's been long since I last used it at college.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
Here I realized that we can use the CSS properties **align-items** and **justify-content** with grid.
